          Zephyr moonlit dance cast a spell upon enchanted forest. Whispering
          leaves pirouetted through the night,while starlight painted a
          celestial tapestry overhead. Mystical creatures gathered in the
          glen,their eyes shimmering with ethereal magic. The ancient trees
          stood as silent witnesses, their branches swaying to the rhythm of a
          secret melody.
